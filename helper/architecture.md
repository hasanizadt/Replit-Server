# Architecture Overview

## Overview

This repository contains a modern e-commerce platform backend built with NestJS and GraphQL. The system is designed with a modular architecture following domain-driven design principles. It uses Prisma as an ORM for database access with PostgreSQL as the underlying database. The API is primarily exposed through GraphQL, with a comprehensive set of features for e-commerce operations including user management, product catalog, orders, payments, shipping, and more.

## System Architecture

### Backend Framework

The application is built using **NestJS**, a progressive Node.js framework that provides a robust structure for building scalable server-side applications. NestJS offers:

- A modular architecture using decorators and dependency injection
- Built-in support for TypeScript
- Comprehensive integration with various libraries and tools

### API Layer

The primary API interface is implemented using **GraphQL** through the `@nestjs/graphql` module and `apollo-server-express`. This provides:

- A strongly-typed API schema automatically generated from TypeScript classes
- Efficient querying capabilities allowing clients to request exactly the data they need
- Built-in documentation through GraphQL introspection
- Support for real-time updates via GraphQL subscriptions

The GraphQL schema is defined using TypeScript decorators and code-first approach, which allows for automatic schema generation from the codebase.

### Database Layer

The application uses **Prisma** as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) with PostgreSQL as the underlying database:

- **Prisma Client** provides type-safe database access with auto-generated queries
- **Prisma Migrate** is used for database schema migrations
- Database connections use **@neondatabase/serverless** suggesting the application is designed to work with Neon's serverless PostgreSQL

Additionally, the code includes references to **Drizzle ORM**, which appears to be used in certain parts of the application or for migration purposes.

### Authentication and Authorization

The system implements a comprehensive authentication and authorization system:

- JWT-based authentication using `@nestjs/jwt`
- Role-based access control (RBAC) through custom decorators and guards
- API key authentication for programmatic access
- Session management with refresh tokens

### Caching

The application uses a multi-layered caching strategy:

- In-memory caching through `@nestjs/cache-manager`
- Redis-based distributed caching for shared state across instances

### Internationalization (i18n)

The application has built-in support for multiple languages using `nestjs-i18n`:

- Translation support for user interfaces
- Validation error messages in multiple languages
- A dedicated translation module for content localization

### Monitoring and Reliability

Several features ensure system reliability and monitoring:

- Health checks through `@nestjs/terminus`
- Scheduled tasks for maintenance operations
- Comprehensive logging system
- Rate limiting via `@nestjs/throttler`

## Key Components

### Core Modules

1. **User Module**: Handles user authentication, registration, profile management, and roles.
2. **Product Module**: Manages product catalog, including categories, attributes, and variants.
3. **Order Module**: Processes orders, tracks status, and manages fulfillment.
4. **Payment Module**: Integrates with payment processors and manages payment status.
5. **Shipping Module**: Configures shipping zones, methods, and calculates shipping costs.
6. **Cart Module**: Manages shopping cart functionality.
7. **Wishlist Module**: Allows users to save products for future consideration.
8. **Feedback Module**: Handles reviews and ratings.
9. **Coupon Module**: Manages promotional codes and discounts.
10. **Notification Module**: Sends transactional emails and notifications.
11. **Analytics Module**: Provides business insights and reporting.
12. **Ticketing Module**: Customer support and issue tracking.
13. **Webhook Module**: Enables integration with external systems through event webhooks.
14. **Status Tracking Module**: Tracks status changes across various entities.

### Support Services

1. **PrismaService**: Provides database access and transaction management.
2. **LoggerService**: Handles application logging with context-aware capabilities.
3. **CacheService**: Manages application caching.
4. **AuthService**: Handles authentication and security.
5. **TranslationService**: Manages content translations.
6. **TasksService**: Schedules and executes background tasks.

## Data Flow

### Request Handling Flow

1. **Client Request**: GraphQL query or mutation is received via HTTP.
2. **Authentication/Authorization**: Request is authenticated and authorized through guards.
3. **Validation**: Input data is validated using class-validator decorators.
4. **Resolver**: Appropriate resolver handles the GraphQL operation.
5. **Service**: Business logic is executed in the service layer.
6. **Data Access**: Prisma client interacts with the database.
7. **Response**: Results are transformed and returned to the client.

### Event Flow

The system appears to implement event-driven patterns for certain operations:

1. **Domain Events**: Status changes and important operations trigger events.
2. **Webhooks**: External systems can subscribe to these events.
3. **Notifications**: Events trigger user notifications.

## External Dependencies

### Primary Dependencies

- **NestJS Ecosystem**: Core framework and related modules
- **GraphQL**: API query language
- **Prisma**: Database ORM
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database (via Neon's serverless offering)
- **Redis**: For caching and possibly message queuing
- **JWT**: Authentication tokens

### Third-party Integrations

The codebase shows potential integration points with:

- Payment processors
- Email/SMS notification services
- File storage services
- Search engines (possibly Elasticsearch or similar)

## Deployment Strategy

The application appears to be designed for cloud deployment with:

- **Docker** support (implied by configuration files)
- **Serverless database** connectivity through Neon PostgreSQL
- Environment-based configuration
- Health check endpoints for container orchestration

## Development Workflow

The repository includes various scripts for development:

- Database migration and seeding tools
- Development server with hot reload
- Testing infrastructure

## Security Considerations

The application implements several security best practices:

- JWT-based authentication with proper expiration
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Role-based authorization
- API rate limiting
- Input validation
- Parameterized database queries via Prisma

## Future Considerations

Areas for potential architectural evolution:

1. **Microservices**: The modular design could evolve into a microservices architecture
2. **Event Sourcing**: The event-driven patterns could be expanded
3. **GraphQL Federation**: The API could be split into federated services
4. **CQRS Pattern**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation could be implemented for complex domains
